# KJ TIMER

This README is under construction, as is this app. If you'd like to use KJ TIMER it's as simple as this:

`git clone <link>`

`cd <directory>`

`npm i`

`npm start`


Now the app should be running on localhost:3000. 

It's also hosted on vercel [here](https://kj-timer.vercel.app/). 

## Ok but what is it? 
KJ Timer is, for now, an app built for one person, and one person only: my partner Kjersten. She got used to using a mobile app called 30/30 for managing long periods of prolonged work, but the app is no longer available and she wanted a suitible alternative. 30/30 was similar to any pomodoro timer, except it allowed the user to set up a schedule "loop." The user builds a stack of many different timers, then they hit START. Once a timer is finished, it moves to the bottom of the stack, and the timer at the top of the stack starts automatically. This encourages the user to adhear to their pre-determined schedule no matter what.

Right now this repo contains a prototype/POC build that my partner is testing. After a couple weeks I'll get her notes on what basic design improvements could be made, and then get to work on the first "real" iteration. If you've downloaded KJ Timer and would like to know more about it please message me.
